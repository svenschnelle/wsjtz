.SH "NAME"
wsprd \- is a decoder for K1JT\*(Aqs Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) mode\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBwsprd\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fIFILE\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBwsprd\fR \- The program is written in C and is a command\-line program that reads from a \&.c2 FILE or \&.wav FILE and writes output to the console\&. It is used by WSJT\-X for wspr\-mode decoding\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-a <path>\fR
.RS 4
Path to writeable data files, default="\&."
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c <file>\fR
.RS 4
Write \&.c2 file at the end of the first pass
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e x\fR
.RS 4
x is transceiver dial frequency error in Hz
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f x\fR
.RS 4
x is transceiver dial frequency in MHz
.RE
.PP
\fB\-H\fR
.RS 4
do not use, or update the hash table
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR
.RS 4
quick mode \- does not dig deep for weak signals
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR
.RS 4
single pass mode, no subtraction (same as original wsprd)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
verbose mode, shows duplicate decodings
.RE
.PP
\fB\-w\fR
.RS 4
wideband mode \- decode signals within +/\- 150 Hz of center
.RE
.PP
\fB\-z x\fR
.RS 4
x is fano metric table bias, default is 0\&.42
.RE
.sp
The FILE can be either \&.wav or \&.c2, for example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\&./wsprd \-wf 14\&.0956 140709_2258\&.wav
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fBNOTE\fR for \&.c2 files, the frequency within the file overrides the command line value\&.
.SH "FEATURES"
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
By default,
\fBwsprd\fR
reports signals that are within +/\- 110 Hz of the subband center frequency\&. The wideband option (\-w) extends this to +/\- 150 Hz\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

\fBwsprd\fR
maintains a hashtable and will decode all three types of wspr messages\&. An option (\-H) is available to turn off use of the hashtable\&.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

The symbols are decoded using Phil Karn\(cqs sequential decoder routine, fano\&.c

.SH "NOTES"

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c

.el \{\

This program attempts to maximize the number of successful decodes per transmit interval by trying to decode virtually every peak in the averaged spectrum\&. The program also implements two\-pass decoding, whereby signals that are successfully decoded are subtracted one\-by\-one during the first decoding pass\&. Then, the decoder is run again\&. In many cases the subtraction process will uncover signals that can then be successfully decoded on the second pass\&.

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
There will be occasional duplicate decodes when two closely spaced peaks come from the same signal\&. The program removes dupes based on callsign and frequency\&. Two decodes that have the same callsign and estimated frequencies that are within 1 Hz will be treated as decodes of the same signal\&. This dupechecking is turned off with the \-v flag\&.
